# Duis - online banking for all
Duis is online banking for everyone. This reference architecture demonstrates software development techniques such as Event Storming, CQRS, Event Sourcing, and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts. It is meant as a guide and example on how a software solution can be development from the very first idea to its full implementation. It is important to note that the business domain of banking is explored first from a business perspective and then demonstrate how business concepts and knowledge can be captured on the implemention side. The intention is also to capture the human aspects of it such as communicating with the domain experts. Since banking is a very complex domain, domain-driven design can help capture the complexity of this domain and improve in the quality of the implentation.

The implementation is accomplished using modern tools and services such as the high-performance .net core runtime coupled with the latest AWS serverless technologies. A critical design goal of the solution architecture is to take full advantage of automation and 100% managed services (AWS services). The solution architecture must provide the business with a list of capabilities to stay very competitive but a have extreamly low cost in operation and maintance. It must also be extensible and business capabilities surely increase over time and driven by market demands and processes.
